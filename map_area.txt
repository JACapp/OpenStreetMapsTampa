The map region I chose to evaluate was the Tampa, Florida metropolitan area.  This region encompasses both urban, suburban, and rural/agricultural areas. I chose this region for nostalgic reasons: I am originally from Florida, my grandmother grew up in the rural areas of this region, and I used to vacation on the Tampa-area beaches every summer as a child.
